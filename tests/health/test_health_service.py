"""Comprehensive tests for HealthService - enhanced replacement for LoggingService.

This module tests the HealthService implementation including:
- Service initialization and configuration
- Health metrics collection and caching
- Event processing and worker performance tracking
- System health monitoring and status determination
- Backward compatibility with LoggingService API
- Integration with ServiceContainer and event-driven architecture

Tests follow Python 3.12+ best practices with function-based approach and modern pytest features.
